# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the performance of customers and sales managers using **Microsoft Excel**. The goal was to explore the data, generate meaningful insights, and enhance skills in Power Query, Power Pivot, Pivot Tables, and Data Visualization.

# Business Problem
Organizations often need to monitor both customer performance and sales team effectiveness. This project simulates that scenario using a sample dataset. The analysis answers questions such as:
1. Which customers are driving the most sales?
2. Which region is contributing the major sales?
3. What customer segment is generating most profit?
4. Trend analysis on Sales & Quantity on Month on Month basis.
